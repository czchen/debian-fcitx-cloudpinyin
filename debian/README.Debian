fcitx-cloudpinyin for Debian
----------------------------

This module can take the advantage of using Pinyin APIs on the
Internet to enhance the experience of any Pinyin input method in
Fcitx. It will display the first result from the Internet API as
second candidate (you can change the order of cloudpinyin candidate)
in Fcitx.

Please be aware by installing and enabling this module, Fcitx will
send your input data to the Internet to retrive the candidate
result. You should disable it when you are working on sensitive
information like confidential documents and your private
information, etc.
